# Improvement Opportunities

1. Several service objects are empty (`TokenService`, `MessageService`, `NotificationService`,
   `AccountService`). Either implement the required domain logic or remove the placeholders to avoid
   runtime surprises.
2. `CoreService` currently returns its own file path and is unused; repurpose it for actual domain
   logic or delete the stub.
3. `EventPublisher` should either be wired to the app's current notification/event mechanism or be
   removed if it is no longer part of the architecture.
4. Add unit/integration tests for `EventPublisher` to verify payload shape, headers, and error
   handling when delivery fails.
5. Move `ENV["RAILS_ENV"] ||= "test"` before the SimpleCov block so coverage reliably starts in the
   test environment.
6. Replace the placeholder Bun test with real expectations that exercise JavaScript helpers or view
   logic.
7. Update the passkey flow to pass the server-provided WebAuthn options into
   `navigator.credentials.create` instead of using hardcoded defaults.
8. Add capability detection and fallback messaging for browsers without WebAuthn support to improve
   the passkey UX.
9. Wrap the Base64 decode in `ValidEmailAddressesController` with validation and exception handling;
   return a 400-style error when decoding fails.
10. In `ValidTelephoneNumbersController`, validate presence/format and return a 422 response with
    error reasons instead of a bare boolean.
11. Include error codes or messages in the inquiry API responses so clients can display meaningful
    feedback to users.
12. Guard the Active Record encryption configuration against missing credentials by using `dig` and
    sensible fallbacks to prevent boot failures.
13. Replace the global `$stderr` override in `config/application.rb` with a library-specific
    workaround to avoid hiding unrelated warnings.
14. Change the `core` service command in `docker-compose` to boot Rails (or Foreman) instead of
    `sleep infinity`, enabling immediate dev usage.
15. Replace the hardcoded `trust` auth and static passwords in the Postgres services with
    environment-driven credentials, even for local development.
16. Provide development defaults or onboarding docs for the `API_*_URL` variables so the scoped
    routes are available out of the box.
17. Split the single JavaScript bundle per site segment so that each layout loads only the scripts
    it needs instead of importing every view module.
18. Stop scanning for `app/javascript/controllers` if it does not exist, or create the directory;
    this avoids unnecessary file system traversal.
19. Swap the `rubocop -A` pre-commit hook for a safer variant (e.g., `--safe-auto-correct`) to
    reduce unintended edits from unsafe cops.
20. Document the intended development workflow for any future asynchronous processing instead of
    assuming an always-on background worker.
