# OAuth 2.1 Compliance Gap Note

Reference: draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1)

## Purpose

This note captures the gap between the OAuth 2.1 draft and the current repository state, so that
Identity-engine implementation work can address the missing items explicitly. It complements
`adr/notes/oidc-session-model.md`, which already records the overall design direction to "align
implementation with OAuth 2.1 direction".

This note is a design-direction document, not a statement that every part of the repository already
implements the model as described.

## Role Split Recap

- Identity provider (AS): `sign.*`, owned by the Identity engine
- Relying parties (RP): `acme`, `base`, `post`, and other future surfaces
- The authorization code + PKCE flow runs between RP and AS as defined in
  `adr/notes/oidc-session-model.md`.

## Explicit Non-Use Declarations

The following OAuth 2.0 grant types are removed in OAuth 2.1 and MUST NOT be implemented in this
repository.

- Implicit grant (OAuth 2.1 §10.1). Tokens MUST NOT be returned directly from the authorization
  endpoint.
- Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC). The AS MUST NOT expose a password grant endpoint, and
  RPs MUST NOT collect end-user credentials to exchange for tokens.

These declarations are normative for this project. Any future proposal to re-introduce either grant
type must replace this note with an accepted ADR.

## redirect_uri Exact String Matching

OAuth 2.1 §2.3.1 requires the AS to reject authorization requests whose `redirect_uri` does not
exactly match a pre-registered value for the client. The check happens in two places, not only on
the front channel.

### Front-channel check (authorize endpoint)

- Endpoint: `/authorize` on `sign.*`
- HTTP method: GET (OAuth 2.1 §3.1 requires the authorization endpoint to support GET)
- Direction: Browser -> AS, with `redirect_uri` carried as a query parameter
- Rule: exact byte-for-byte match against the client's registered `redirect_uri` set.

### Back-channel check (token endpoint)

- Endpoint: `/token` on `sign.*`
- HTTP method: POST, server-to-server from RP to AS
- Rule: the `redirect_uri` sent with the code exchange MUST equal the `redirect_uri` used in the
  earlier authorize request. This prevents code substitution between different registered URIs of
  the same client.

### Loopback exception

OAuth 2.1 §2.3.1 permits the port component of loopback redirect URIs (`http://127.0.0.1/...` and
`http://[::1]/...`) to vary. This project's RPs are server-side web applications, so the default
position is to not enable the loopback exception. If a native or CLI client is added later, it
requires a separate design.

### Required work for this repository

- define where registered `redirect_uri` values live (AS side, Identity engine model)
- decide how client registration is authored (static config vs. managed table)
- add integration tests that reject unregistered, suffix-extended, and scheme-mismatched
  `redirect_uri` values on both endpoints
- keep the exact-match rule aligned with PKCE state/verifier handling described in
  `adr/notes/oidc-session-model.md`.

## Open Gaps Against OAuth 2.1

Items below are known gaps or items that still need verification against current implementation.
