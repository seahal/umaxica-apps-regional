## 1. SMS + Passkey Required (Login Establishment) ✅

### Adopted spec: A (no full login until passkey is completed)

- SMS OTP verification **does not** establish a full session by itself.
- After SMS OTP success, the user **must** complete passkey registration before a session is
  created.
- If a user already has an active passkey, SMS OTP success can complete login immediately.

### Implementation

- `Sign::App::Up::TelephonesController` redirects to
  `sign_app_up_telephone_passkey_registration_path`
- `PasskeyRegistrationController` (Stimulus) handles browser WebAuthn API
- Views at `sign/app/up/passkey_registrations/show.html.erb`

### OTP resend (SMS)

- Resend is allowed even if the telephone record is missing or unverified (no existence leak).
- Rate limit: 60s cooldown per session for resend attempts.
- Response is generic on success; rate-limited responses use a generic cooldown message.

## 2. Unlink / Disable Conditions (Social / Email / Telephone / Secret) ✅

### Common guards (applies to all unlink/disable actions)

- **Recent Reauth required**: use the existing step-up gate (`Verification::Base::STEP_UP_TTL`,
  currently 15 minutes).
- **No lockout**: after removal, the user must still have **at least one** remaining
  authentication/recovery method.
- "Last method" removal is rejected with a user-facing error.
- Audit log entry is required for each unlink/disable action.

### Implementation

- `AuthMethodGuard.last_method?(actor, excluding:)` checks remaining auth methods
- Controllers use `require_step_up!(scope: "social_unlink")` for sensitive actions
- Flash message: `t("sign.app.configuration.email.destroy.last_method")`

### What counts as an authentication/recovery method

- Email: `UserEmailStatus::VERIFIED` or `VERIFIED_WITH_SIGN_UP`.
- Telephone: `UserTelephoneStatus::VERIFIED` or `VERIFIED_WITH_SIGN_UP`.
- Passkey: `UserPasskeyStatus::ACTIVE`.
- Secret (login or recovery): `UserSecretStatus::ACTIVE`.
- Social: Google/Apple identities in `ACTIVE` status.

### Telephone unlink interpretation

- Telephone is not mandatory.
- If removed, it is considered **SMS login disabled** for that user.

### Secret disable rules

- `enabled=false` or destroy is treated as unlink and is guarded by the same rules.

## 3. Emergency Key (Issued After Passkey Registration) ✅

### Adopted spec

- After a passkey is registered, an Emergency Key is issued automatically.
- Stored in DB as a `UserSecret` with `user_secret_kind_id = RECOVERY` and **hashed** (never
  plaintext).
- Plaintext is shown **only once** on a dedicated page, then removed from session.
- Re-issuing invalidates prior active recovery secrets (set to `REVOKED`).

### Implementation

- Service: `UserSecrets::IssueRecovery`
- Audit log event: `UserActivityEvent::RECOVERY_CODES_GENERATED` (id: 13)
- Audit log use event: `UserActivityEvent::RECOVERY_CODE_USED` (when used to authenticate)

## 4. Withdrawal (2-way only) 🚧

### Adopted spec (based on current implementation + tests)

- Two-way model is **"withdraw (reversible)" ↔ "recover"** within a fixed recovery window.
- Permanent deletion is **not** available via UI in this sprint.
- `/configuration/withdrawal` should present **only the reversible path**.
- If permanent deletion is needed later, it must be moved to a separate flow (support or delayed
  job).

### Behavior

- Withdraw sets `withdrawn_at` and `status_id = PRE_WITHDRAWAL_CONDITION`.
- Recovery clears `withdrawn_at` if within `Withdrawable::WITHDRAWAL_RECOVERY_PERIOD` (30 days).
- Withdrawal gate confines users in PRE_WITHDRAWAL status to the withdrawal page until recovered.

### Status

- Reversible withdrawal: **Implemented**
- Permanent deletion: **Deferred** (not in this sprint)

## 5. public_id Boundary ✅

### Adopted spec

- In configuration area, `totps`, `passkeys`, and `secrets` must use `public_id` in routes and
  lookup.
- `UserPasskey` must be upgraded to include a `public_id` (string, 21 chars, unique).

### Implementation

- `UserPasskey` model includes `public_id` column (string, 21 chars, not null, unique index)
- Routes use `public_id` for passkey resources
