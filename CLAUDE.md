## Architecture

### Application Module: `Jit::Application`

Ruby 4.0.1 / Rails 8.1 (from `rails/rails` main branch). PostgreSQL 18+ required for native
`uuidv7()`.

### Multi-Domain, Multi-Audience Structure

The app serves multiple domains, each split into three audience tiers: **app** (end users), **org**
(staff), **com** (corporate/public). Routes are host-constrained and modularized:

| Route file              | Domain purpose                                     | Hosts (dev)                                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config/routes/sign.rb` | Authentication (sign-in/up, MFA, passkeys, social) | `sign.app.localhost`, `sign.org.localhost`                    |
| `config/routes/apex.rb` | Dashboard shell & preferences                      | `app.localhost`, `org.localhost`, `com.localhost`             |
| `config/routes/core.rb` | Main app backend (contacts, content management)    | `www.app.localhost`, `www.org.localhost`, `www.com.localhost` |
| `config/routes/docs.rb` | Documentation delivery                             | `docs.com.localhost`                                          |
| `config/routes/news.rb` | News/blog delivery                                 | news domains                                                  |
| `config/routes/help.rb` | Help system                                        | help domains                                                  |

Controllers mirror this: `app/controllers/sign/app/`, `app/controllers/sign/org/`,
`app/controllers/apex/com/`, etc.

### Multi-Database Architecture (20 databases)

Each database has a write (pub) and read replica (sub) connection. Key databases:

| Database     | Migration dir            | Purpose                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `principal`  | `db/principals_migrate`  | Users & staff identity       |
| `operator`   | `db/operators_migrate`   | Staff/operator management    |
| `token`      | `db/tokens_migrate`      | Auth tokens (access/refresh) |
| `preference` | `db/preferences_migrate` | User/staff preferences       |
| `guest`      | `db/guests_migrate`      | Guest contacts               |
| `document`   | `db/documents_migrate`   | CMS documents                |
| `news`       | `db/news_migrate`        | News posts                   |
| `activity`   | `db/activity_migrate`    | Audit logs                   |
| `occurrence` | `db/occurrences_migrate` | Rate-limiting events         |
| `avatar`     | `db/avatars_migrate`     | Avatar/social profiles       |
| `queue`      | `db/queues_migrate`      | SolidQueue jobs              |
| `cache`      | `db/caches_migrate`      | SolidCache                   |

Schema files: `db/<name>_schema.rb` (e.g., `db/principal_schema.rb`). The root `db/schema.rb` also
exists.

### Authentication & Security

- **WebAuthn/FIDO2** for passkeys (requires `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` env var for all Rails commands)
- **OmniAuth** for social login (Apple, Google)
- **Cloudflare Turnstile** for bot protection (standard + stealth modes) via `TurnstileConfig` /
  `TurnstileVerifier`
- **Pundit** for authorization policies
- **Rack::Attack** for rate limiting
- **Custom `CsrfValidation` middleware** for API endpoints
- **ActiveRecord Encryption** for sensitive data (keys in Rails credentials)
- **Argon2 + bcrypt** for password hashing

Auth concerns: `Auth::User` (user sessions), `Auth::Staff` (staff sessions), `Auth::Passkey`,
`Auth::StepUp`.

### Frontend

- **Hotwire** (Turbo + Stimulus) with **Importmap** (no bundler)
- **Propshaft** asset pipeline (not Sprockets)
- **Tailwind CSS** via `tailwindcss-rails` gem
- **Biome** for JS linting/formatting
- Stimulus controllers in `app/javascript/controllers/`

### Key Patterns

- **Structured logging**: Use `Rails.event.record("event.name", payload)` instead of `Rails.logger`
- **UUIDv7 primary keys**: Generated by PostgreSQL's native `uuidv7()`, not Rails-side
- **Public IDs**: Models use `PublicId` concern for URL-safe Nanoid identifiers
- **Frozen string literals**: Required in all Ruby files
- **Sorbet**: Runtime type checking via `sorbet-runtime`
- **i18n default locale**: Japanese (`:ja`)

### Test Organization

- `test/unit/` - Unit tests (no DB required, runnable with `SKIP_DB=1`)
- `test/models/` - Model tests (require DB)
- `test/controllers/` - Controller tests (require DB, mirror controller namespaces)
- `test/integration/` - Integration tests (full request stack)
- `test/services/`, `test/jobs/`, `test/mailers/`, `test/policies/` - Domain-specific tests
- `test/support/` - Shared helpers (auth bypass via `X-TEST-CURRENT-USER` / `X-TEST-CURRENT-STAFF`
  headers)
- Test fixtures loaded selectively in `test/test_helper.rb` (not `fixtures :all`)

### Docker Compose Services

PostgreSQL 18 (primary + replica with WAL streaming), Valkey (port 56379), Kafka + Zookeeper,
SeaweedFS (S3-compatible storage), Grafana + Loki + Tempo (observability), Cloudflare Tunnel.

### CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/integration.yml`)

Runs on push to develop/main and PRs. Jobs: actionlint, hadolint, Brakeman + bundler-audit,
gitleaks, Semgrep, RuboCop + erb_lint, Rails test suite (with Postgres 18 + Valkey + Kafka), Biome +
pnpm audit, container image scanning (Trivy + Grype).

## Requirements Analysis Best Practices

### Verify with multiple sources

Always verify initial understanding against primary sources. Never proceed on assumptions alone.

1. **Hypothesis**: Recognize intuitive understanding as a hypothesis
2. **Primary sources**: Check implementation code (highest trust) > prototypes > specs
3. **Contradictions**: If sources contradict each other, do NOT resolve independently -- report to
   user for decision
4. **Confirm**: Before implementing, output confirmed sources and current understanding as bullet
   points for user agreement

## Quality Considerations

Use ISO/IEC 25010 as a quality lens when designing, implementing, reviewing, and testing changes.

- Consider the relevant characteristics explicitly: functional suitability, performance efficiency,
  compatibility, usability, reliability, security, maintainability, and portability.
- When tradeoffs materially affect scope, architecture, or test coverage, call out which quality
  characteristics were prioritized and which were deferred.

<!--VITE PLUS START-->

# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown,
Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend
tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, but it invokes Vite through
`vp dev` and `vp build`.

## Vite+ Workflow

`vp` is a global binary that handles the full development lifecycle. Run `vp help` to print a list
of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

### Start

- create - Create a new project from a template
- migrate - Migrate an existing project to Vite+
- config - Configure hooks and agent integration
- staged - Run linters on staged files
- install (`i`) - Install dependencies
- env - Manage Node.js versions

### Develop

- dev - Run the development server
- check - Run format, lint, and TypeScript type checks
- lint - Lint code
- fmt - Format code
- test - Run tests

### Execute

- run - Run monorepo tasks
- exec - Execute a command from local `node_modules/.bin`
- dlx - Execute a package binary without installing it as a dependency
- cache - Manage the task cache

### Build

- build - Build for production
- pack - Build libraries
- preview - Preview production build

### Manage Dependencies

Vite+ automatically detects and wraps the underlying package manager such as pnpm, npm, or Yarn
through the `packageManager` field in `package.json` or package manager-specific lockfiles.

- add - Add packages to dependencies
- remove (`rm`, `un`, `uninstall`) - Remove packages from dependencies
- update (`up`) - Update packages to latest versions
- dedupe - Deduplicate dependencies
- outdated - Check for outdated packages
- list (`ls`) - List installed packages
- why (`explain`) - Show why a package is installed
- info (`view`, `show`) - View package information from the registry
- link (`ln`) / unlink - Manage local package links
- pm - Forward a command to the package manager

### Maintain

- upgrade - Update `vp` itself to the latest version

These commands map to their corresponding tools. For example, `vp dev --port 3000` runs Vite's dev
server and works the same as Vite. `vp test` runs JavaScript tests through the bundled Vitest. The
version of all tools can be checked using `vp --version`. This is useful when researching
documentation, features, and bugs.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Using the package manager directly:** Do not use pnpm, npm, or Yarn directly. Vite+ can handle
  all package manager operations.
- **Always use Vite commands to run tools:** Don't attempt to run `vp vitest` or `vp oxlint`. They
  do not exist. Use `vp test` and `vp lint` instead.
- **Running scripts:** Vite+ built-in commands (`vp dev`, `vp build`, `vp test`, etc.) always run
  the Vite+ built-in tool, not any `package.json` script of the same name. To run a custom script
  that shares a name with a built-in command, use `vp run <script>`. For example, if you have a
  custom `dev` script that runs multiple services concurrently, run it with `vp run dev`, not
  `vp dev` (which always starts Vite's dev server).
- **Do not install Vitest, Oxlint, Oxfmt, or tsdown directly:** Vite+ wraps these tools. They must
  not be installed directly. You cannot upgrade these tools by installing their latest versions.
  Always use Vite+ commands.
- **Use Vite+ wrappers for one-off binaries:** Use `vp dlx` instead of package-manager-specific
  `dlx`/`npx` commands.
- **Import JavaScript modules from `vite-plus`:** Instead of importing from `vite` or `vitest`, all
  modules should be imported from the project's `vite-plus` dependency. For example,
  `import { defineConfig } from 'vite-plus';` or
  `import { expect, test, vi } from 'vite-plus/test';`. You must not install `vitest` to import test
  utilities.
- **Type-Aware Linting:** There is no need to install `oxlint-tsgolint`, `vp lint --type-aware`
  works out of the box.

## CI Integration

For GitHub Actions, consider using
[`voidzero-dev/setup-vp`](https://github.com/voidzero-dev/setup-vp) to replace separate
`actions/setup-node`, package-manager setup, cache, and install steps with a single action.

```yaml
- uses: voidzero-dev/setup-vp@v1
  with:
    cache: true
- run: vp check
- run: vp test
```

## Review Checklist for Agents

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to validate changes.
