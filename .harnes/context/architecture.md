# Architecture

## Overview

This is a multi-surface Ruby on Rails application.

Surfaces:

- app (end-user application)
- org (staff / organization)
- com (public / corporate)

Each surface MUST be treated as an independent boundary.

---

## Controller Responsibilities

Controllers MUST:

- Handle HTTP concerns only
- Delegate business logic to models/services
- Enforce authentication, authorization, and verification

Controllers MUST NOT:

- Contain heavy business logic
- Access other surfaces directly
- Bypass pipeline concerns

---

## Data Layer

- ActiveRecord is used
- Direct SQL is forbidden unless explicitly justified
- Bulk operations must be carefully reviewed

---

## Separation of Concerns

- Controllers: request/response
- Models: domain logic
- Policies: authorization
- Concerns: cross-cutting behavior

---

## Non-Negotiable Rules

DO NOT:

- Mix surfaces (app/org/com)
- Share state across requests
- Store request data in class variables

ALWAYS:

- Respect boundaries
- Keep logic deterministic
