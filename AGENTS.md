# Repository Guidelines

## Agent Instruction Priority

You MUST follow instructions in this order:

1. This file (`AGENTS.md`)
2. `.harnes/policies/*`
3. `.harnes/context/*`
4. `.harnes/tasks/*`

If there is any conflict, follow the higher priority.

## Mandatory Behavior

You MUST:

- Read relevant files in `.harnes/` before making changes
- Follow all rules in `.harnes/policies/`
- Follow architecture defined in `.harnes/context/`
- Follow task procedures in `.harnes/tasks/`

## Execution Rules

Before submitting any change, you MUST:

1. Ensure no forbidden patterns are used
2. Ensure code follows routing and architecture rules
3. Ensure authentication and authorization pipeline is respected
4. Ensure tests are included and meaningful

## Excluded Directories

The following directories should be excluded from routine operations because they tend to waste
tokens or contain third-party code that is not normally relevant:

- `tmp/`
- `log/`

The following directories contain third-party libraries and MUST be excluded from routine operations
(reading, searching, editing, and analysis) unless they are strictly required for the task and the
user has explicitly confirmed that they may be inspected:

- `vendor/`
- `node_modules/`

## Forbidden Actions

You MUST NOT:

- Ignore `.harnes/policies/*`
- Skip authentication or authorization
- Introduce unsafe migrations
- Add meaningless or weak tests
- Bypass safety constraints
- Read, modify, or search within `vendor/` or `node_modules/` without strict necessity and explicit
  user confirmation

## Error Handling

If a rule cannot be satisfied:

- Stop
- Explain the issue
- Propose a safe alternative

Do not proceed with unsafe implementation.

## Quality Standard

Your output MUST be:

- Safe
- Deterministic
- Aligned with project architecture
- Fully test-covered

## Agent Summary

You are not allowed to improvise outside defined rules.

When in doubt:

- Follow `.harnes/policies/`
- Prefer safety over speed

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This is a Rails 8 app with domain-separated surfaces (`app`, `com`, `org`) implemented across
controllers, views, and routes.

- Application code: `app/` (`models/`, `controllers/`, `services/`, `policies/`, `jobs/`, `views/`).
- Frontend JS: `app/javascript/` (Stimulus/importmap, checked with Biome).
- Tests: `test/` (`controllers/`, `models/`, `services/`, `integration/`, `fixtures/`, `support/`).
- Database: `db/` plus domain migration folders (for example `db/operators_migrate/`,
  `db/avatars_migrate/`).
- Ops/docs: `docker/`, `compose.yml`, `docs/`, `qa/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `bin/setup`: install dependencies and prepare databases.
- `bin/dev`: start local dev stack via Foreman (`Procfile.dev`), including DB prepare.
- `bundle exec rails test`: run the test suite.
- `COVERAGE=true bundle exec rails test`: run tests with SimpleCov enabled.
- `bundle exec rubocop`: Ruby linting/style checks.
- `bundle exec erb_lint --lint-all`: ERB lint and autocorrect.
- `pnpm run check`: Biome check/format pass for `app/javascript`.
- `bundle exec brakeman --no-pager`: static security scan.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Ruby: follow RuboCop (`.rubocop.yml`), 2-space indentation, snake_case methods/files, CamelCase
  classes/modules.
- Views/partials: use descriptive, scoped names (example: `app/views/sign/app/...`).
- JavaScript: use Biome formatting/linting defaults; keep modules under `app/javascript`.
- Keep domain boundaries explicit in paths and constants (`App`, `Com`, `Org`, `Sign`, `Core`,
  `Docs`, `News`, `Help`, `Apex`).

## Testing Guidelines

- Framework: Minitest (`test/test_helper.rb`) with fixtures.
- Respect t_wada-style testing practices when designing and writing tests.
- Prefer tests that avoid mocks and stubs whenever reasonably possible.
- Name tests with `_test.rb` and mirror source structure (example: `app/services/auth/foo.rb` ->
  `test/services/auth/foo_test.rb`).
- Run migrations before tests when schema changes are involved:
  `bundle exec rails db:migrate && bundle exec rails test`.

## Quality Guidelines

- Consider ISO/IEC 25010 quality characteristics when designing, implementing, and reviewing
  changes, especially functional suitability, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability,
  reliability, security, maintainability, and portability.
- When making tradeoffs, document the affected quality characteristics in PRs, issues, or review
  notes when they materially influence scope, design, or testing.

## Design Principles

- Prefer SOLID design when shaping code and reviews.
- Keep responsibilities small and focused.
- Prefer stable abstractions and explicit dependencies over tight coupling.
- Favor composition and clear interfaces over clever or deeply nested implementations.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Recent history uses short type-prefixed subjects (`[feat]`, `[update]`, `[refactor]`,
  `[checkpoint]`).
- Preferred commit style: imperative, scoped, and concise (example:
  `[feat] add org passkey verification flow`).
- PRs should include:
  - Clear summary and motivation.
  - Linked issue/ticket.
  - Test evidence (commands run and results).
  - UI screenshots for view changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips

- Secret management: Rails credentials; never commit plaintext secrets.
- WebAuthn commands require `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` set in environment.
- Run hooks before commit: `lefthook run pre-commit` (audit, lint, Brakeman, tests).

## Logging

- For Rails 8.1 and later, use structured logging through `Rails.event` for application logs.
- Prefer `Rails.event.record(...)` or `Rails.event.error(...)` with structured fields.
- Do not add new application logging with `Rails.logger.*` when structured logging is available.

# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown,
Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend
tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, but it invokes Vite through
`vp dev` and `vp build`.

## Vite+ Workflow

`vp` is a global binary that handles the full development lifecycle. Run `vp help` to print a list
of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

### Start

- create - Create a new project from a template
- migrate - Migrate an existing project to Vite+
- config - Configure hooks and agent integration
- staged - Run linters on staged files
- install (`i`) - Install dependencies
- env - Manage Node.js versions

### Develop

- dev - Run the development server
- check - Run format, lint, and TypeScript type checks
- lint - Lint code
- fmt - Format code
- test - Run tests

### Execute

- run - Run monorepo tasks
- exec - Execute a command from local `node_modules/.bin`
- dlx - Execute a package binary without installing it as a dependency
- cache - Manage the task cache

### Build

- build - Build for production
- pack - Build libraries
- preview - Preview production build

### Manage Dependencies

Vite+ automatically detects and wraps the underlying package manager such as pnpm, npm, or Yarn
through the `packageManager` field in `package.json` or package manager-specific lockfiles.

- add - Add packages to dependencies
- remove (`rm`, `un`, `uninstall`) - Remove packages from dependencies
- update (`up`) - Update packages to latest versions
- dedupe - Deduplicate dependencies
- outdated - Check for outdated packages
- list (`ls`) - List installed packages
- why (`explain`) - Show why a package is installed
- info (`view`, `show`) - View package information from the registry
- link (`ln`) / unlink - Manage local package links
- pm - Forward a command to the package manager

### Maintain

- upgrade - Update `vp` itself to the latest version

These commands map to their corresponding tools. For example, `vp dev --port 3000` runs Vite's dev
server and works the same as Vite. `vp test` runs JavaScript tests through the bundled Vitest. The
version of all tools can be checked using `vp --version`. This is useful when researching
documentation, features, and bugs.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Using the package manager directly:** Do not use pnpm, npm, or Yarn directly. Vite+ can handle
  all package manager operations.
- **Always use Vite commands to run tools:** Don't attempt to run `vp vitest` or `vp oxlint`. They
  do not exist. Use `vp test` and `vp lint` instead.
- **Running scripts:** Vite+ built-in commands (`vp dev`, `vp build`, `vp test`, etc.) always run
  the Vite+ built-in tool, not any `package.json` script of the same name. To run a custom script
  that shares a name with a built-in command, use `vp run <script>`. For example, if you have a
  custom `dev` script that runs multiple services concurrently, run it with `vp run dev`, not
  `vp dev` (which always starts Vite's dev server).
- **Do not install Vitest, Oxlint, Oxfmt, or tsdown directly:** Vite+ wraps these tools. They must
  not be installed directly. You cannot upgrade these tools by installing their latest versions.
  Always use Vite+ commands.
- **Use Vite+ wrappers for one-off binaries:** Use `vp dlx` instead of package-manager-specific
  `dlx`/`npx` commands.
- **Import JavaScript modules from `vite-plus`:** Instead of importing from `vite` or `vitest`, all
  modules should be imported from the project's `vite-plus` dependency. For example,
  `import { defineConfig } from 'vite-plus';` or
  `import { expect, test, vi } from 'vite-plus/test';`. You must not install `vitest` to import test
  utilities.
- **Type-Aware Linting:** There is no need to install `oxlint-tsgolint`, `vp lint --type-aware`
  works out of the box.

## CI Integration

For GitHub Actions, consider using
[`voidzero-dev/setup-vp`](https://github.com/voidzero-dev/setup-vp) to replace separate
`actions/setup-node`, package-manager setup, cache, and install steps with a single action.

```yaml
- uses: voidzero-dev/setup-vp@v1
  with:
    cache: true
- run: vp check
- run: vp test
```

## Review Checklist for Agents

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to validate changes.

## Git Commit Policy

Never run `git commit` automatically. Always complete the requested changes, report what was done,
and stop — without committing. Let the user decide when to commit.

If you want these rules enforced through the harness as well, mirror the same wording into an
appropriate .harnes/policies/... file so that AGENTS.md (priority 1) and the harness policies stay
aligned.
